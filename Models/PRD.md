Of course. Here is the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for your **Leafify** project, updated to reflect the advanced **Ensemble Learning** approach.

### **Product Requirements Document: Leafify**

* **Status:** In Development
* **Author:** AI Assistant & Project Lead
* **Last Updated:** September 3, 2025

### ## 1. Introduction & Vision

**Leafify** is an intelligent, web-based application designed to provide users with highly accurate plant disease diagnoses. By leveraging an **ensemble of state-of-the-art deep learning models**, users can upload an image of a plant leaf and receive an instant analysis based on an "expert consensus" from multiple AI models. The vision is to provide a diagnosis that is more robust and reliable than any single model could offer, making expert-level analysis accessible to everyone.

### ## 2. The Problem

Incorrect or delayed identification of plant diseases can lead to significant crop loss and the misuse of pesticides. While single-model AI systems can be effective, they can sometimes make confident but incorrect predictions. A more reliable system is needed to provide users with the highest possible degree of confidence in the diagnosis.

### ## 3. Target Audience

* **Home Gardeners**: Individuals seeking reliable advice for their personal plants.
* **Small to Medium-Scale Farmers**: Agricultural producers who need a cost-effective and highly accurate tool for monitoring crop health.
* **Agricultural Students & Researchers**: As a tool for learning about and demonstrating advanced ML techniques.

### ## 4. Features & Requirements (MVP)

#### ### 4.1 Core Functionality: The AI Pipeline

* **FR1.1 - Image Upload**: Users must be able to upload a single image (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`) through the web interface.
* **FR1.2 - Ensemble-Based Disease Classification**: The backend system must process the image using an ensemble of multiple deep learning models.
    * **Base Models**: The ensemble will consist of at least two different architectures: **EfficientNetB4** and **ResNet50**.
    * **Ensemble Method**: The system will use **soft voting** (averaging probabilities) to combine the predictions from each model into a single, highly reliable result.
    * **Output**: The API will return the final predicted disease name and the combined confidence score.
* **FR1.3 - API Endpoint**: A robust API endpoint (`/api/predict`) built with **FastAPI** will handle the file upload and return the ensemble prediction in a structured JSON format.

#### ### 4.2 Frontend / User Interface

* **FR2.1 - Upload Interface**: A clean and responsive user interface for uploading an image, built with **Vite/React**.
* **FR2.2 - Display of Results**: The interface must clearly display the final diagnosis (predicted disease) and the combined confidence score from the ensemble.
* **FR2.3 - Loading State & Error Handling**: The UI must show a clear processing indicator and handle potential errors gracefully.

---

### ## 5. Technology Stack

* **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
* **Frontend**: Vite, React
* **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
* **Ensemble Models**: **EfficientNetB4**, **ResNet50**
* **Data Source**: [Plant Disease Classification - Merged Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alinedobrovsky/plant-disease-classification-merged-dataset)



---

### ## 6. Out of Scope for MVP

* User accounts and prediction history.
* Detailed disease information or treatment suggestions.
* Batch image processing.
* A native mobile application.

---

### ## 7. Success Metrics

* **Model Accuracy**: The final ensemble model must achieve a target accuracy of **>99%** on the unseen test set.
* **API Response Time**: The average time from image upload to result display should be under 8 seconds, acknowledging the use of multiple models.
* **Usability**: Successful completion of the upload-analyze-result workflow by test users.
