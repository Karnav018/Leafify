## ## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Architecture

Leafify uses a decoupled frontend/backend architecture for modern development and scalability.

* **Frontend**: Vite, React, CSS3
* **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
* **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow (Keras), OpenCV, NumPy
* **Dataset**: [Plant Disease Classification - Merged Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alinedobrovsky/plant-disease-classification-merged-dataset)

### ### Architecture

The frontend (built with Vite) communicates with the backend (built with FastAPI) via a REST API. The backend handles image processing and runs the inference using the trained TensorFlow model.
