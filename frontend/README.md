### **1. Introduction & Vision**

**Leafify** is an intelligent, web-based application designed to provide farmers, gardeners, and agricultural professionals with a rapid and accessible tool for diagnosing plant diseases. By leveraging the power of computer vision and deep learning, users can upload an image of a plant leaf and receive an instant analysis, including the identification of potential diseases and a confidence score. The vision is to democratize plant pathology, making expert-level diagnosis available to anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection, thereby promoting healthier crops and reducing yield loss.

### **2. The Problem**

Identifying plant diseases accurately often requires specialized knowledge or access to agricultural experts, which can be time-consuming and costly. A delayed or incorrect diagnosis can lead to:
* Significant crop loss.
* The improper use of pesticides and fungicides, harming the environment.
* Financial instability for farmers.

Leafify aims to solve this by providing an immediate, data-driven "first opinion" on plant health.

### **3. Target Audience**

* **Home Gardeners:** Individuals who need quick, accessible advice on the health of their personal plants.
* **Small to Medium-Scale Farmers:** Agricultural producers who need a cost-effective tool to monitor crop health in the field.
* **Agricultural Students & Researchers:** As a tool for learning and data collection.

### **4. Features & Requirements (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)**

#### **4.1 Core Functionality: The AI Pipeline**

* **FR1.1 - Image Upload:** Users must be able to upload a single image (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`) through a web interface.
* **FR1.2 - Leaf Detection & Cropping:** The backend system must automatically identify the primary leaf within the uploaded image and crop it to isolate it from the background.
* **FR1.3 - Disease Classification:** The cropped leaf image must be processed by a trained deep learning model to classify its condition. The model will output:
    * The predicted disease name (e.g., "Tomato___Bacterial_spot").
    * A confidence score (e.g., 92%) for the prediction.
* **FR1.4 - API Endpoint:** A robust API endpoint (`/api/predict`) built with FastAPI must be available to handle the file upload and return the prediction results in a structured JSON format.

#### **4.2 Frontend / User Interface**

* **FR2.1 - Upload Interface:** A clean, simple, and responsive user interface for uploading an image. This will be built using Vite and a modern framework like React.
* **FR2.2 - Display of Results:** After a successful analysis, the interface must clearly display:
    * The original image uploaded by the user.
    * The predicted disease name.
    * The confidence score of the prediction.
* **FR2.3 - Loading State:** The UI must show a clear loading or processing indicator while the backend is analyzing the image.
* **FR2.4 - Error Handling:** The UI must display user-friendly error messages if the upload fails, the file format is incorrect, or the backend returns an error.

### **5. Technology Stack**

* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
* **ML/CV Libraries:** TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy
* **ASGI Server:** Uvicorn
* **Frontend:** Vite, React (or similar JS framework)
* **Data Source:** The initial model will be trained on the **PlantVillage** dataset.

---

### **6. Out of Scope for MVP**

To ensure a focused and timely initial release, the following features will **not** be included in the Minimum Viable Product:
* User accounts and login functionality.
* History of previous uploads.
* Detailed information about the diseases or treatment suggestions.
* Batch image processing (uploading multiple files at once).
* A native mobile application.

---

### **7. Success Metrics**

The success of the Leafify MVP will be measured by:
* **Model Accuracy:** The classification model should achieve a target accuracy of >95% on the test dataset.
* **Processing Time:** The average time from image upload to result display should be under 5 seconds.
* **Usability:** Successful completion of the upload-analyze-result workflow by test users without assistance.
